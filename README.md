This is an attempt at rebuilding the iOS app [Neko Atsume](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nekoatsume/id923917775) for the web using Rails and Postgres

This version attempts to replicate the iOS version as closely as possible.

So far, only base fucionality (no cats yet) has been built, but between what's up on [heroku](http://cat-collector.herokuapp.com), and the rspec tests, the functionality/logic should be pretty straighforward ;)

Next step is to add Cat behavior, which I hope to get to soon...
