This is a web version of the iOS app [Neko Atsume](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nekoatsume/id923917775)

This version attempts to replicate the iOS version as closely as possible.

So far, only basic fucionality has been built, but between what's up on cat-collector.herokuapp.com, and the rspec tests, the funcitionality/logic should be pretty straighforward ;)

Next step is to add Cat behavior, which I hope to get to soon...
